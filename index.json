Married, father of 2 adorable kids. I love running, all sorts of DYI and experimentations. Stargazing is another passion. A handy man in general, and renovations is another hobby. I read books, or listen to them; preffering Science fiction, technology books, process improvements, psycology. Listen to podcasts when commuting.\nWhat I Write About (intend to) Technology in general Things I encounter in my day to day live Personal projects and experiments Tips and tutorials Life experiences and reflections My technology stack is mostly Microsoft based, with deep experience in on-premise Windows Server administration and architecture, Azure as my main cloud provider, Azure DevOps and GitHub as development platform. PowerShell is my tool of choice, Pyhon is an alternative. I also spend lots of my time on the #linux environment, mostly in the shell, with Docker and Kubernetes.\nI hold various certifications, as follows:\nAzure: Az-104, Az-305, Az-500, Az-900 Windows server: GitHub: GH-100, GH-200, GH-900 Linux: LPI Level 1 (long expired, but the skills are there) Feel free to explore the posts and reach out if you\u0026rsquo;d like to connect!\n","permalink":"https://blog.cibotaru.com/about/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"about-me\"\u003eAbout Me\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy name is Sergiu Cibotaru, born in Moldova, and now I live in The Netherlands since 2022.
